Data science is an emerging field that combines data analysis with computer programming to provide practical insights for organizations and social problems. 
<br><br>
In order to accelerate and improve the analytical process, Pete Warden created a website called <a href="http://www.datasciencetoolkit.org/" target="_blank">The Data Science Toolkit</a> which consisted of useful APIs and tools for with data. We have borrowed the idea to provide some tools for using data for nonprofit scholarship.
<br><br>
If you wish to embrace the <a href="http://openscience.org/what-exactly-is-open-science/" target="_blank">open science movement</a>, which values transparent and reproducible research, and if you wish to leverage new and interesting data sources for nonprofit scholarship, then you will need to start building your own data science toolkit.

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

An Application Program Interface (API) is a standard that allows two program to speak to each other. There are many data publishers that have developed APIs that allow you send a request for data through R, and receive the data directly in R, without having to go to a website and download files, then import them into R.
<br><br>
Follow the link above for an example of how the Census API can simplify your life by allowing you to query Census datasets and return you desired set of variables aggregated by your desired geographic unit.

R has developed a package called Shiny which allows you to write code in R, and translate the code automatically to HTML and javascript, the foundational languages of web pages. This allows you to create dynamic web applications which allow the user to interact with data in interesting ways. For example, if you are working with a local school district, you can create a simple application that allows them to generate reports on behavioral problems or absenteeism, where they can select the specific grades, neighborhoods, and racial groups of interest. This means they can now drill down into the data to gain insight into trends.

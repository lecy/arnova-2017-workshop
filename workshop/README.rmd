# Workshop Material

This folder contains the markdown and data files from the 2017 ARNOVA pre-conference workshop on Open Data / Open Science for nonprofit research.

The **data** folder contains data used for the examples.


## Necessary R Packages

If you would like to follow along with examples during the workshop, please open an R terminal and install the following packages:

```{r}

workshop.packages <- c( "dplyr","geojsonio","ggmap","maps",
                        "maptools","raster","rgdal","rgeos",
                        "sp","gender","igraph","httr","tidyverse",
                        "stringr","RCurl","reshape2","RColorBrewer",
                        "extrafont","knitr" )

install.packages( workshop.packages )

# to install one at a time:
# install.packages( "package.name" )


```

## Workshop Content


### The Data Science Ecosystem

You do not need a degree in computer science or statistics to master some basic data science skills. You do, however, need to learn a few tools.

Although these tools are not trivial (R has a bit of a learning curve), they are accessible and powerful. In general, I have found that it requires only one course for students to become conversant in R. After about 3 semesters they are proficient. *Fluency requires dating a computer.*


#### [Data Programming Languages](https://lecy.github.io/arnova-2017-workshop/workshop/r_overview.html)

* Why learn R? 


#### [Data-Driven Documents: Markdown Basics](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

* Explains the basics of markdown documents
* See some of the [interesting document formats](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/formats.html) that you can produce!



#### [Importing Data Through APIs](https://lecy.github.io/arnova-2017-workshop/workshop/census_api_example.html)

* How does an API work? 
* Examples of useful R packages that leverage APIs

## RESEARCH VIGNETTES

<br>

#### [Female Pay Disparity Example](https://lecy.github.io/arnova-2017-workshop/workshop/coding_gender.html)

* Uses the **gender** package in R
* Uses compensation and board data from the IRS e-filer database


#### [Spatial Analysis Example](https://lecy.github.io/arnova-2017-workshop/workshop/spatial_example.html)

* Uses nonprofits in Grand Rapids from the IRS Master File
* Geocodes addresses using the **ggmap** package and Google Maps API
* Visualizes spatial proximity using GIS tools in R


#### [Board Network Example](https://lecy.github.io/arnova-2017-workshop/workshop/board_networks.html)

* Uses board data from the IRS e-filer database
* Uses an approximate or fuzzy matching technique to reconcile names
* Uses the **igraph** package for network visualization


#### Census Data Made Easy

* Uses the **censusapi** package and the US Census API
* Demonstrates how to specify unique geographic units through the API
* Demonstrates how to easily import the most commmon and useful demographic and economic variables

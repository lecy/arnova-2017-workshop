Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

R has developed a package called Shiny which allows you to write code in R, and translate the code automatically to HTML and javascript, the foundational languages of web pages. This allows you to create dynamic web applications which allow the user to interact with data in interesting ways. For example, if you are working with a local school district, you can create a simple application that allows them to generate reports on behavioral problems or absenteeism, where they can select the specific grades, neighborhoods, and racial groups of interest. This means they can now drill down into the data to gain insight into trends.
